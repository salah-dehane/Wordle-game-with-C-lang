# Wordle-game-with-C-lang 🎮

A classic Wordle clone built entirely in **C**. This project demonstrates string manipulation, terminal coloring using ANSI escape codes, and game logic implementation.

## 🕹️ Gameplay
The rules are simple: Guess the hidden 5-letter word in 6 attempts.
- 🟩 **Green**: Letter is correct and in the right spot.
- 🟨 **Yellow**: Letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
- ⬛ **Gray**: Letter is not in the word.



## 🛠️ Features
- **ANSI Color Support**: High-fidelity terminal colors for an authentic experience.
- **Input Sanitization**: Handles uppercase/lowercase and invalid word lengths.
- **Lightweight**: Zero external dependencies (only standard C libraries).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You need a C compiler like `gcc` or `clang`.

## 🇩🇿 Fun Fact
The source code comments are written in **Algerian Dialect (Darija)**. 
It's a tribute to the Algerian coding community! 
Example: `// hna nchoufou ida lharf sahih wala lala` (Here we check if the letter is correct or not).
