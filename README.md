# Wordle-game-with-C-lang 🎮

A classic Wordle clone built entirely in **C**. This project demonstrates string manipulation, terminal coloring using ANSI escape codes, and game logic implementation.

## 🕹️ Gameplay
The rules are simple: Guess the hidden 5-letter word in 6 attempts.
- 🟩 **Green**: Letter is correct and in the right spot.
- 🟨 **Yellow**: Letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
- ⬛ **Gray**: Letter is not in the word.



## 🛠️ Features
- **ANSI Color Support**: High-fidelity terminal colors for an authentic experience.
- **Input Sanitization**: Handles uppercase/lowercase and invalid word lengths.
- **Lightweight**: Zero external dependencies (only standard C libraries).
